# Docker Compose with Multiple Local Containers

[Back to contents](/README.md)

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

[Documentations on docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 1) Creating and using docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: '3'

services:
    redis-server:
        image: 'redis'
    node-app:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "4001:8081"
```

This docker-compose.yml file specifies that we want to run two services. One is made of a *redis* image and another should be build of the Dockerfile found inside the same directory. Also we bind ports from container 8081 to local 4001  

To run this compose file use:

```
docker-compose up
```

If you have made changes in configuration or files you'll need to *rebuild* and run this compose file use:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

If you want to run container in background use:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

In oeder to stop all containers use:

```
docker-compose down
```

### 2) Restart policy for containers

```yml
version: '3'

services:
    redis-server:
        image: 'redis'
    node-app:
        restart: always
        build: .
        ports:
            - "4001:8081"
```

Another options for restart are:

```
restart: "no"
restart: always
restart: on-failure
restart: unless-stopped
```

### 3) Monitor changes on the fly

If we need to monitor the changes of files on the fly, we should use:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app/ <container-id>
```

Here the node_modules folder does not exist in the source folders, without it there will be an error as the node_modules folder will be overwritten by mapping ```-v $(pwd):/app/```

### 4) Wrapping react app project in docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - .:/app
```
